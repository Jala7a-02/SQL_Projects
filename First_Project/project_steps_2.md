* Helps track trends and identify seasonality in your data

```sql
SELECT date_column, SUM(measure_column)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY date_column;
```

## 📊 Cumulative Analysis

* Aggregate the data progressively over time
* Helps understand whether the business is growing or declining

```sql
SELECT date_column, SUM(measure_column) OVER (ORDER BY date_column) AS cumulative_value
FROM table_name;
```

## 🏁 Performance Analysis

* Compare the current value with a target value
* Helps measure success and performance

```sql
SELECT current_value - target_value AS performance_gap
FROM table_name;
```

## 🧩 Part-to-Whole (Proportional Analysis)

* Analyze how an individual part performs compared to the overall
* Helps understand which category has the greatest impact

```sql
SELECT category_column,
       (SUM(measure_column) * 100.0 / SUM(SUM(measure_column)) OVER ()) AS percentage_contribution
FROM table_name
GROUP BY category_column;
```

## 🧮 Data Segmentation

* Group the data based on specific ranges
* Helps understand correlation or distribution between two measures

```sql

## 🧾 Build Customer Report

* Create summarized views by customer segment
