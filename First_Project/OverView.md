# 📊 EDA with SQL – Data Exploration Project

Welcome to my **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) SQL Project**!  
This project demonstrates the power of SQL for uncovering insights from raw data through analytical queries, visual summaries, and pattern discovery.

## 🌟 Project Overview

This repository showcases how SQL can be used for **data exploration**, **pattern recognition**, and **preliminary data cleaning**. Using structured queries, I explore a real-world dataset to answer business questions, generate meaningful statistics, and set the stage for deeper data analysis or machine learning.

## 🧠 Objectives

- Perform **descriptive analysis** using SQL
- Identify **data distributions**, **key trends**, and **outliers**
- Apply **grouping**, **aggregation**, **joins**, **subqueries**, and **window functions**
- Highlight **important KPIs** and insights for stakeholders

## 📁 Dataset

all datasets used in this project are included in the datasets file


## 🔍 Key Analyses Performed

- Summary statistics (e.g., totals, averages, min/max)
- Time-based trends
- Categorical distribution analysis
- Top-performing segments (e.g., best-selling products, most active users)
- Data quality checks (missing values, duplicates, etc.)
